Two composition approaches, i.e., sequential and parallel are designed considering the different behaviors of drone swarms. The proposed framework considers various constraints, e.g., recharging time and limited battery to meet delivery deadlines. We propose SDaaS composition algorithms using a modified A* algorithm. A cooperative behavior model is incorporated to reduce recharging and waiting time in a delivery. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Precision agriculture is starting to play a key role in the new generation of modern agricultural revolution. Farmers are increasingly aware of the importance of maintaining direct control of several fundamental aspects such as the state of health of crops, the amount of water or fertilizer, and possible infections that can develop in the field. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and multispectral imaging (MSI) have been applied for these matters for some decades. Nevertheless, there are still several technological and practical barriers to face. This chapter provides an overview of some of the relevant scientific literature related to the application of HSI and MSI on crop fields. Some of the applications are related to the detection of contaminants and heavy metals, the control and assessment of water sources, and the detection of the health status of the fields. The main advantages and constraints and the methods to acquire the images (by using satellites or aerial vehicles) are also shown and discussed.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have significantly disrupted the aviation industry. As technology and policy continue to develop, this disruption is only going to increase in magnitude. A specific technology poised to escalate this disruption is UAV swarm. UAV swarm has the potential to distribute tasks and coordinate operation of many UAVs with little to no operator intervention. This paper surveys literature regarding UAV swarm and proposes a swarm architecture that will allow for higher levels of swarm autonomy and reliability by utilizing cellular mobile wireless communication infrastructure. This paper chronicles initial testbed development to meet this proposed architecture. Focused development of UAV swarms with UAV-to-UAV communication autonomous coordination ability is central to advancing the utility of UAV swarms. The use of cellular mobile framework alleviates many limiting factors that hinder the utility of UAVs including range of communication, networking challenges, and size-weight-and-power considerations. In addition, cellular networks leverage a robust and reliable infrastructure for machine to machine communication proposed by 5G systems.},

Automated drones and different robots in savvy cultivating applications offer the possibility to screen ranch arrive on a for each plant premise, which thus can diminish the measure of herbicides and pesticides that must be applied. There is a gap between current food productivity growth and needed growth. To boost the yield, farmers switched to extensive use of chemical fertilizers. Excessive fertilizer usage has its negative impact like decreased yield, wastage of fertilizer, damage to soil, and groundwater contamination. Currently, farmers mostly rely on guesswork, estimation, experience when deciding the crop that should grow, and the fertilizer that should be used. In this paper, we have proposed a solution that uses technologies like Machine Learning, Image Processing, and the Internet of things to improvise farm productivity and at the same time, decrease the fertilizer usage. This paper describes the outcomes of a prototype implemented in Rajasthan, India.},

  abstract = {This work presents a review and discussion of the challenges that must be solved in order to successfully develop swarms of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) for real world operations. From the discussion, we extract constraints and links that relate the local level MAV capabilities to the global operations of the swarm. These should be taken into account when designing swarm behaviors in order to maximize the utility of the group. At the lowest level, each MAV should operate safely. Robustness is often hailed as a pillar of swarm robotics, and a minimum level of local reliability is needed for it to propagate to the global level. An MAV must be capable of autonomous navigation within an environment with sufficient trustworthiness before the system can be scaled up. Once the operations of the single MAV are sufficiently secured for a task, the subsequent challenge is to allow the MAVs to sense one another within a neighborhood of interest. Relative localization of neighbors is a fundamental part of self-organizing robotic systems, enabling behaviors ranging from basic relative collision avoidance to higher level coordination. This ability, at times taken for granted, also must be sufficiently reliable. Moreover, herein lies a constraint: the design choice of the relative localization sensor has a direct link to the behaviors that the swarm can (and should) perform. Vision-based systems, for instance, force MAVs to fly within the field of view of their camera. Range or communication-based solutions, alternatively, provide omni-directional relative localization, yet can be victim to unobservable conditions under certain flight behaviors, such as parallel flight, and require constant relative excitation. At the swarm level, the final outcome is thus intrinsically influenced by the on-board abilities and sensors of the individual. The real-world behavior and operations of an MAV swarm intrinsically follow in a bottom-up fashion as a result of the local level limitations in cognition, relative knowledge, communication, power, and safety. Taking these local limitations into account when designing a global swarm behavior is key in order to take full advantage of the system, enabling local limitations to become true strengths of the swarm.},

  abstract = {Civilian drones are soon expected to be used in a wide variety of tasks, such as aerial surveillance, delivery, or monitoring of existing architectures. Nevertheless, their deployment in urban environments has so far been limited. Indeed, in unstructured and highly dynamic scenarios, drones face numerous challenges to navigate autonomously in a feasible and safe way. In contrast to traditional “map-localize-plan” methods, this letter explores a data-driven approach to cope with the above challenges. To accomplish this, we propose DroNet: a convolutional neural network that can safely drive a drone through the streets of a city. Designed as a fast eight-layers residual network, DroNet produces two outputs for each single input image: A steering angle to keep the drone navigating while avoiding obstacles, and a collision probability to let the UAV recognize dangerous situations and promptly react to them. The challenge is however to collect enough data in an unstructured outdoor environment such as a city. Clearly, having an expert pilot providing training trajectories is not an option given the large amount of data required and, above all, the risk that it involves for other vehicles or pedestrians moving in the streets. Therefore, we propose to train a UAV from data collected by cars and bicycles, which, already integrated into the urban environment, would not endanger other vehicles and pedestrians. Although trained on city streets from the viewpoint of urban vehicles, the navigation policy learned by DroNet is highly generalizable. Indeed, it allows a UAV to successfully fly at relative high altitudes and even in indoor environments, such as parking lots and corridors. To share our findings with the robotics community, we publicly release all our datasets, code, and trained networks.},

Furthermore, the algorithms for autonomous navigation, such as state-of-the-art (SoA) visual navigation deep neural networks (DNNs), are becoming increasingly complex, striving for more flexibility and agility. In this work, we present a sensor-rich, modular, nano-sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), almost as small as a five Swiss Franc coin - called Fünfliber - with a total weight of 18g and 7.2cm in diameter. We conceived our UAV as an open-source hardware robotic platform, controlled by a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) system-on-chip (SoC) with a wide set of onboard sensors, including three cameras (i.e., infrared, optical flow, and standard QVGA), multiple Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, a barometer, and an inertial measurement unit. Our system runs the tasks necessary for a flight controller (sensor acquisition, state estimation, and low-level control), requiring only 10\% of the computational resources available aboard, consuming only 9mW - 13x less than an equivalent Cortex M4-based system. Pushing our system at its limit, we can use the remaining onboard computational power for sophisticated autonomous navigation workloads, as we showcase with an SoA DNN running at up to 18Hz, with a total electronics' power consumption of 271mW.},

  abstract = {Agriculture plays a vital role in the global economy. WHO states that there are three pillars of food security: availability, access, and usage. Among these three pillars, availability is the most important one. Ensuring food for the entire population of a country is achieved only through an increase in crop production. Accurate and timely forecasting of the weather can help to increase the yield production. Early prediction of crop yield has a vital role in food availability measure. Researchers monitor different parameters that affect the crop yield regularly. Yield prediction did through either statistical data or spatial data. Crop monitoring through remote sensing can cover a vast land area. Therefore, spatial data-based prediction is widespread in recent decades. Satellite images such as multispectral, hyperspectral, and radar images were used to calculate crop area, soil moisture, field greenness, etc. Among these imaging modalities, hyperspectral images give more accurate results, but its higher dimensionality is a challenging issue. Optimal band selection from hyperspectral images helps to reduce this curse of dimensionality problem. Crop area is one of the essential parameters for yield prediction. The exact crop area measure can be achieved only through the best crop discrimination methods. This paper provides a comprehensive review of crop yield prediction using hyperspectral images. Besides, we explore the research challenges and open issues in this area.},

First, B-spline characterisations of the flat output allow for optimal trajectory generation subject to waypoint constraints, thrust and angle constraints while minimising the trajectory length. Second, the proposed tracking control strategy combines feedback linearisation and nested saturation control via flatness. The control strategy provides bounded inputs (thrust, roll and pitch angles) while ensuring the overall stability of the tracking error dynamics. The control parameters are chosen based on the information of the a priori given reference trajectory. Moreover, conditions for the existence of these parameters are presented. The effectiveness of the trajectory planning and the tracking control design is analysed and validated through simulation and experimental results over a real nano-quadcopter platform, the Crazyflie 2.0.},
